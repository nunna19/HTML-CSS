        <h3>What does a Software Engineer do?</h3>

        <blockquote> "The process is complicated and intricate, therefore the use of diagrams, flowchart" </blockquote>

        <p class="no1">A software engineer applies mathematical analysis and the principles of computer science in order to design and develop computer software. There are many types of software that a software engineer can develop, such as operating systems, computer games, middleware, business applications and network control systems. Changes in technology and new areas of specialization keeps this profession evolving at a rapid pace.</p>

        <p class="no2">When working with a client, a software engineer will typically analyze the client's needs, then design, test, and develop the computer software in order to meet those needs. They are experts in computing systems, software structure, and recognizing the limitations of the existing hardware. </p>
